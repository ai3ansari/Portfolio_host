                <p>Writing is something that just happened to me. I belong to the very diverse fraternity of engineering by academics as well as by profession. Started with Technical Writing back in the days of university life, I tried my skills on Biography and Essay Writing afterwards. Then gradually I opened myself up for the domains such as Website Content Development, Project Reporting, Case Studies Writing and somewhat Blogging. Thanks to the nature of my profession; Data Analysis, Project Management and Research Writing have become significant parts of my job. This blend has also polished my analytical and strategic skillset. Being a tech-savvy, most of my work spins around engineering topics and futuristic ideas. It also led me to get my hands on creative infographics designing and interactive dashboards building.</p>
